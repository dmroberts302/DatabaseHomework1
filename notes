writeRecord: a private helper method
input parameter(s): name, rank, city, state, zip, employees
returns: Boolean (true if file is open, false otherwise)
purpose: Using formatted writes, writes a fixed length record at the current location of the dbFileptr.

create database: creates two files filename.config, filename.data

Fortune500.config: contains the number of records in the sorted data file. This will be the number of records in the input 
data, e.g., 500 It may also contain any other information you find helpful. You may hardcode the names and sizes of the fields 
in your program, but you could use the config file to describe the names, sizes of the fields in order, anything else you want.

filename.data:contains the data records, one per line, with fixed size fields. The first field is the key for each record and 
the records are assumed to be in sorted order by the key. You may use any separator you want (or no separator). To allow for 
adding additional records, you should write 2 blank fixed length records after each real record read from the input data file
